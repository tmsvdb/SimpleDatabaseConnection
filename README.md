# SimpleDatabaseConnection

USE:
1. Run a MySql Database Server on a localhost or server location.
2. Open a connection with a MySql Database using the Connect form.
3. Use the treeview in the contentform to navigate through all off the databases you have access to.
4. Add & remove databases, add & remove table to databases and insert new rows to your databases.

2. Users should not be able to use the tabs between "Database info" & "Table info"
